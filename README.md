# Dashly
A barebones build of a dashboard built for a client to use to avoid 3rd party software and keep order management in house.  Built using ElectronJS bundled with ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Backend functionality not included in this build as per client's request but would build on a MongoDB and NodeJS pairing for database functionality.
Barebones Dashboard can be seen below:
